MissingOutputException in line 14 of /mnt/c/Users/livio/evol-feat-snakemake/workflow/rules/merge_features.smk:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
