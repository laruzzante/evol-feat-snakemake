rule compute_UNI:
    input: data/orthology_anophelinae.tsv
    output: results/UNI.tsv, results/UNI_genes.tsv
    jobid: 0

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 3 of /home/lruzzant/evol-feat-snakemake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/UNI_genes.tsv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.

Removing output files of failed job compute_UNI since they might be corrupted:
results/UNI.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
