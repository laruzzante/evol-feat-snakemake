# OrthoDB orthology table:
# if directly coming from OrthoDB v10 or lower, a script will automatically format it.
# Ortherwise, respect the column format:
# orthogroup <\t> gene <\t> species
# Make sure that gene names are unique across species, in order to avoid potential downstream flaws.
# One way to make gene ids unique is to simply attach the species name to it.
